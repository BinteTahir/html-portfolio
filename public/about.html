<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Binte Tahir is a sixteen-year-old author, writes poetry in English, Urdu, and Arabic. Born in Karachi, Pakistan, she belongs to an open-minded family. She dreamed of a charming future but, early on, something frowned upon in her middle-class household. She moved along some hardships, which left her with post-traumatic stress disorder for some years of her life. This marked a transition in her early life from one carefree childhood to one with relative uncertainty. Despite her life being dogged by some adversities, she is very generous and has dreamed of an artistic career. In the deadly silences, she led her to herself. She led her to need her own heart. She led her to her own voice. She began to ferment social and domestic life, ideas, injustice, and a need for retaining the child as a child, not an adult.</p>

<p>She has embraced a responsibility to speak about the things we humans face and experience but lacks the courage of the expression to speak those out. She tries to balance her words and lines in a manner that may give her readers a vein and intense feelings of relatability. She describes the home as a place not only for living but where the soul and heart feel at peace. As a metaphor, her story is the first inkling.</p>

<p>As well as being a humanistic novelist, she always tries to become a humanitarian, in real life. She brings the real-life characters and the modern era, obstacles in her novel to make the book readers, especially the ones who mentally love to live in an academy that smells wood and old books at the head of a secret society, aware of the joys of real life. She writes realistically about children tackling problems and experiencing emotions that readers could empathize with. She wants to technically arrange the ink lines on a page to make the readers feel the same feelings they felt in their real lives.
